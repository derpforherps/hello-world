# hello-world

I'm a PhD student at UIUC under Dr. Chris Phillips and Dr. Matt Allender DVM.
My dissertation focuses on the effects of ranavirus on amphibian communities in Illinois. 
I am particularly interested in the question of how wildlife communities interact with and respond to pressures from particularly devastating pathogens. I hope to pursue a career at a federal agency that will allow me to explore this broad interest, or a career as an educator in higher learning.
